# Data Types

## Admin vs. Country-Report

This is an ambiguous definition, but closely related

- What we call "Admin" data is a blend of the two
	- MOSTLY composed of "country-report" data
- The JRF reports both 

1. Country-report
	1. A proportion of vaccine coverage for the target population,
	   1. arrived at through conversations between countries and WUENIC
	1. Mostly national level, with some exceptions e.g. US states
	1. Our team most heavily favors this value, and uses "admin" data to fill gaps
1. Admin
	1. Two counts
		1. doses administered
		1. size of target population

## DHS

[Demographic and Health Survey (USAID)](https://dhsprogram.com)

## MICS

[Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (UNICEF)](https://mics.unicef.org/surveys)

- we use survey data if there's a large discrepancy between MICS report and microdata
	- for all others, we prefer microdata

## JRF

[Joint Reporting Form (WHO/UNICEF)](https://www.who.int/teams/immunization-vaccines-and-biologicals/immunization-analysis-and-insights/global-monitoring/who-unicef-joint-reporting-process)

- administrative coverage data and official country-reported data

## HBR

Home-based record

## Parental recall

Interview, memory recall

# Programs

## UNICEF

[United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund](https://www.unicef.org)

## EPI

Expanded Programme on Immunization (1974)

- DTP1 & 3, MCV1, BCG, Polio3
- All introduced ~globally by beginning of modeled time series (1980)

## WUENIC

[WHO/UNICEF estimates of national immunization coverage](https://www.who.int/teams/immunization-vaccines-and-biologicals/immunization-analysis-and-insights/global-monitoring/immunization-coverage/who-unicef-estimates-of-national-immunization-coverage)

## GVAP

Global Vaccine Action Plan 

- [GVAP (WHO)](https://www.who.int/teams/immunization-vaccines-and-biologicals/strategies/global-vaccine-action-plan)
	- [2020 Annual report](https://apps.who.int/iris/rest/bitstreams/1320721/retrieve)

> At least 90% national-level coverage across vaccines
> 
> The Global Vaccine Action plan (GVAP) was developed to help realize the vision of the Decade of Vaccines, that all individuals and communities enjoy lives free from vaccine preventable diseases.  

## GAVI

A "public-private" partnership

- successor to Children's Vaccine Initiative
- focus on introducing new vaccines
- increase from 6 original EPI vaccines to 9 
- we work with the Monitoring and Evaluations team

[Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization](https://www.gavi.org)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAVI

> In 2016, Gavi channeled more than half of total donor assistance for health, and most donor assistance for immunization, by monetary measure.
> 
> Gavi supports the immunization of almost half the world's children. Gavi has helped immunize over 760 million children, preventing over 13 million deaths worldwide, helping increase diphtheria vaccine coverage in supported countries from 59% in 2000 to 81% in 2019, contributing to reducing child mortality by half. It also seeks to improve the economics of vaccines, negotiating bulk prices, supporting price discrimination, and reducing the commercial risks that manufacturers face when selling vaccines to the poor and developing vaccines. It also provides funding to strengthen health systems and train health workers across the developing world, though the effectiveness of its health-system-strengthening programs is disputed.

## IA 2030

Immunization Agenda 2030

- [IA 2023 (WHO)](https://www.who.int/teams/immunization-vaccines-and-biologicals/strategies/ia2030)
	- [2030 Strategy Document](https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/immunization/strategy/ia2030/ia2030-draft-4-wha_b8850379-1fce-4847-bfd1-5d2c9d9e32f8.pdf?sfvrsn=5389656e_69&download=true)

> IA2030 envisions a world where everyone, everywhere, at every age, fully benefits from vaccines to improve health and well-being. It aims to maintain hard-won gains in immunization, recover from the disruptions caused by COVID-19, and achieve even more – by leaving no one behind, in any situation or at any stage of life.
